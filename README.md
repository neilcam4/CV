## Neil Campbell

After a successful career in teaching Mathematics, I was keen to embark on a new challenge and take my career forward. I had been learning how to program independently for the past two years and developed my own web app to support my teaching (www.snowytopmaths.co.uk). In July 2019 I decided to turn my hobby into my new career and began the software engineering course at Makers Academy. My initial excitement for turning my ideas into fuition has continued to grow as I have developed my skills further and learnt the industry's best practices. I am excited to launch myself into a new career in tech, to continue improving as a developer and utilise my management and people skills from my former experience.
